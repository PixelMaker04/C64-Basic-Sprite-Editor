# C64-Basic-Sprite-Editor
A javascript and html program to assist in basic sprite decimal data for the Commdore 64

**Note:Currently the output bitmap data does not work.

This program allows you to create a commodore basic sprite visually while the decimal data is output on the right.
The design was to make it essentilly a 1 and 0 of pixels on and off for the sprite.

# How-to
Just like with most pixel art programs, just click on the spot you want to have enabled.
Click the same cell again to deselect the pixel data.

Once you are done with the sprite click "export decimal data".
You will then be prompted to input a filename.
The file is downloaded to whereever you have set up your downloads to go.
